# Harbor

## Getting students on the same page

An iPad app that loads sets of urls as pushed by the teacher.

### What problems does it solve?
* It saves time: students to not need to waste classroom time typing urls
* It avoids distractions: no url bar, so students are not tempted to browse the internet at large
* With some extension, it can allow teachers to "push" information directly to the student's iPad
* Teachers can build sets of urls ahead of time, and direct students to them at will *"Open the Harbor app and read through the three pages I've shared. In ten minutes, we'll look at three more."*
